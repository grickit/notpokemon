Coding Conventions

Every file will have a cleanliness tag at the top for how well it sticks to these conventions
//# CLEAN
//# DIRTY
//# AUDIT ME
Also make special notes about old style, todos for the file, and anything else noteworthy.


Every class gets its own file.


Classes are named LikeThisHere


Methods are named likeThisHere


Properties are named like_this_here


Classes are surrounded in this:
// ----- CLASS: NameOfClass {
// ----- }


Try to keep the amount of global anonymous objects low.


Organize the members of classes with these comments:
// ----- Properties
// ----- Methods
// ----- Initialize
